**Updating a graph with a GAF** A csv file is created that contains an anchor sequence on the left and right side to localize the change. This csv is transformed into a fasta file to be used by graph aligners. The resulting GAF file and initial csv can be provided to the update command to incorporate the new sequence where the alignment occurred.
