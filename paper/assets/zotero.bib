  abstract = {Abstract                            Computational pangenomics is an emerging research field that is changing the way computer scientists are facing challenges in biological sequence analysis. In past decades, contributions from combinatorics, stringology, graph theory and data structures were essential in the development of a plethora of software tools for the analysis of the human genome. These tools allowed computational biologists to approach ambitious projects at population scale, such as the 1000 Genomes Project. A major contribution of the 1000 Genomes Project is the characterization of a broad spectrum of genetic variations in the human genome, including the discovery of novel variations in the South Asian, African and European populations---thus enhancing the catalogue of variability within the reference genome. Currently, the need to take into account the high variability in population genomes as well as the specificity of an individual genome in a personalized approach to medicine is rapidly pushing the abandonment of the traditional paradigm of using a single reference genome. A graph-based representation of multiple genomes, or               a graph pangenome               , is replacing the linear reference genome. This means completely rethinking well-established procedures to analyze, store, and access information from genome representations. Properly addressing these challenges is crucial to face the computational tasks of ambitious healthcare projects aiming to characterize human diversity by sequencing 1M individuals~(Stark et~al. 2019). This tutorial aims to introduce readers to the most recent advances in the theory of data structures for the representation of graph pangenomes. We discuss efficient representations of               haplotypes               and the variability of               genotypes               in graph pangenomes, and highlight applications in solving computational problems in human and microbial (viral) pangenomes.},

  abstract = {The Computational Pan-Genomics Consortium (Consortium, 2016) described the role of coordinate systems in genomics as follows: ``A pan-genome defines the space in which (pan-)genomic analyses take place. It should provide a `coordinate system' to unambiguously identify genetic loci and (potentially nested) genetic variants.'' The most natural representations of pangenomes are graphs. The Computational Pan-Genomics Consortium identified desirable properties of the linear reference genome model that graphical frameworks should attempt to preserve: spatiality, monotonicity, and readability. In this paper, we introduce a coordinate system for DAGs that has these properties. It is based on the level function and a minimum path cover of the graph. Moreover, we describe a new method for finding a minimum path cover in a DAG, which works very well in practice.},

  abstract = {Low-cost whole-genome assembly has enabled the collection of haplotype-resolved pangenomes for numerous organisms. In turn, this technological change is encouraging the development of methods that can precisely address the sequence and variation described in large collections of related genomes. These approaches often use graphical models of the pangenome to support algorithms for sequence alignment, visualization, functional genomics, and association studies. The additional information provided to these methods by the pangenome allows them to achieve superior performance on a variety of bioinformatic tasks, including read alignment, variant calling, and genotyping. Pangenome graphs stand to become a ubiquitous tool in genomics. Although it is unclear whether they will replace linearreference genomes, their ability to harmoniously relate multiple sequence and coordinate systems will make them useful irrespective of which pangenomic models become most common in the future.},

These models offer the opportunity to study the entire genomic diversity of a population, including structurally complex regions. Nevertheless, analyzing hundreds of gigabase-scale genomes using pangenome graphs is difficult as it is not well-supported by existing tools. Hence, fast and versatile software is required to ask advanced questions to such data in an efficient way.},

  abstract = {We present a generalization of the positional Burrows--Wheeler transform, or PBWT, to genome graphs, which we call the gPBWT. A genome graph is a collapsed representation of a set of genomes described as a graph. In a genome graph, a haplotype corresponds to a restricted form of walk. The gPBWT is a compressible representation of a set of these graph-encoded haplotypes that allows for efficient subhaplotype match queries. We give efficient algorithms for gPBWT construction and query operations. As a demonstration, we use the gPBWT to quickly count the number of haplotypes consistent with random walks in a genome graph, and with the paths taken by mapped reads; results suggest that haplotype consistency information can be practically incorporated into graph-based read mappers. We estimate that with the gPBWT of the order of 100,000 diploid genomes, including all forms structural variation, could be stored and made searchable for haplotype queries using a single large compute node.},

It has been successfully applied to identical by descent (IBD) segment identification and genotype imputation. Once the PBWT of a haplotype panel is constructed, it supports efficient retrieval of all shared long segments among all individuals (long matches) and efficient query between an external haplotype and the panel. However, the standard PBWT is an array-based static data structure and does not support dynamic updates of the panel.},
